					<p>On April 1st, 2AM in Australia, Dennis decided he would prank the staff by posting this on the internal staff forums.
</p><p>"I think I might have mentioned this to a few of you in the past few weeks, but we just got confirmation of this last night.
</p><p>Chris and I have been in private discussions with the SMF development team, and we agree that both development teams are way too small for efficient development of a free modern web application that can compete in the forum software industry. As an example, we delayed MyBB 1.6 for nearly half a year because of lack of resources, and on the other side SMF's 2.0 has been in development since 2005. With the way web development is evolving these days, the old-fashioned release cycle we have cannot keep up with the latest technologies.
</p><p>Both of our groups have major releases coming up in the near future, for us with 1.6, and SMF with 2.0. We have agreed that once we have both released our products, that we will be merging together to produce a new forum software (we were due for a rewrite anyway with MyBB 2.0, and also SMF's 2.0 framework was developed in 2005 and is frankly becoming obsolete even before it is released).
</p><p>The big downfall is that SMF wants to take over and drive the project after the merger. Chris and I have finally decided to be OK with that and we have submitted to them because we want to take advantage of the additional people and their experience, so that we can concentrate on the development, and hopefully have our ideas heard along the way, but it cannot be guaranteed.
</p><p>We just wanted to let you know so that you would be prepared when this happens (probably in mid-summer). We also want to know whether or not you will be on board with us in this merger, please leave your decision/opinion.
</p><p>Edit: They've just set up a private forum for discussion on the merger on their site, so if you are on board, please register there <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/">http://www.simplemachines.org/community/</a> and post your username here and I'll get them to add you to the forum's access list."
</p><p>You can read the thread it got, here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-67184.html">http://community.mybb.com/thread-67184.html</a>
Note: This does not represent any staffs opinions, nor MyBB's in general, it was just an April Fools Day prank.
